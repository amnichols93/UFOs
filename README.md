# UFOs
Module 11

Module 11 involved building html and js files that work together to build a page that allows the user to sift through data on UFO sighting. The user can filter the data by date, city, state, country, and shape of the UFO as recorded. The page allows the user to filter and reset the data conveniently from the same part of the page that holds their filter selections. Additionally, the header includes a space-themed photo as the background and the first "row" of the page is a brief article about UFOs that is hardcoded.
